## Definition
**Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus** (TYLCV) is a viral disease that affects tomato plants, caused by the *Begomovirus*. This virus is transmitted by the whitefly (*Bemisia tabaci*) and can cause severe yield loss.

## Symptoms

   - Stunted growth and bushy appearance.
   - Leaves may become thick and leathery.

2. **Plant Symptoms**:
   - Overall stunted growth.

3. **Transmission**:
   - Transmitted primarily by whiteflies.
   - Can be spread by infected plant material and seeds.

## Treatment
1. **Resistant Varieties**:
   - Planting tomato varieties that are resistant to Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

2. **Vector Control**:
   - Control whitefly populations using insecticides, insecticidal soaps, or natural predators.
   - Use yellow sticky traps to monitor and reduce whitefly populations.

3. **Sanitation**:
   - Remove and destroy infected plants and debris to reduce sources of viral inoculum.
   - Clean tools and equipment with a disinfectant to prevent the spread of the virus.

4. **Cultural Practices**:
   - Use reflective mulches to repel whiteflies.
