# Tomato Spider Mites (Two-Spotted Mite)

## Definition
**Tomato Spider Mites**, specifically the Two-Spotted Mite (*Tetranychus urticae*), are tiny arachnids that feed on tomato plants, causing significant damage by sucking plant juices. This pest can lead to reduced plant vigor and yield.

## Symptoms
1. **Leaf Spots**:
   - Tiny, yellow or white speckles on the leaves, often referred to as "stippling."
   - Leaves may turn bronze or yellow and eventually drop off.

2. **Webbing**:
   - Fine webbing on the undersides of leaves and between stems and leaves.
   - Webbing becomes more pronounced as the infestation worsens.

3. **Reduced Plant Vigor**:
   - Stunted growth and reduced yield due to loss of chlorophyll and plant sap.

## Treatment
1. **Biological Control**:
   - Introduce natural predators like predatory mites (*Phytoseiulus persimilis*), lady beetles, or lacewings.

2. **Cultural Practices**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of spider mites.
   - Remove and destroy heavily infested leaves to reduce mite populations.

3. **Miticide Application**:
   - Use miticides specifically labeled for spider mite control, following label instructions.
   - Rotate miticides with different modes of action to prevent resistance development.

4. **Proper Spacing and Pruning**:
   - Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
   - Prune lower leaves to improve airflow around the base of the plants.

5. **Watering Practices**:
   - Avoid water stress by maintaining consistent soil moisture, as stressed plants are more susceptible to mite infestations.
   - Use a strong water spray to physically remove mites from the plants.

6. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of spider mite infestation.
   - Use a magnifying glass to detect mites on the undersides of leaves and take action promptly.
