# Tomato Early Blight

## Definition
**Tomato Early Blight** is a common fungal disease affecting tomato plants, caused by the fungus *Alternaria solani*. This disease can lead to significant yield losses and affects leaves, stems, and fruits of tomato plants.

## Symptoms
1. **Leaf Spots**:
   - Small, dark brown or black spots with concentric rings, often referred to as "target spots."
   - Spots typically appear on the older, lower leaves first.
   - Leaves may yellow and die, leading to defoliation.

2. **Stem Lesions**:
   - Dark, sunken lesions on the stems, particularly near the soil line.
   - Lesions can girdle the stem, leading to wilting and plant death.

3. **Fruit Spots**:
   - Dark, leathery spots with concentric rings on the fruit.
   - Fruit spots often start near the stem end and can cause the fruit to rot.

## Treatment
1. **Resistant Varieties**:
   - Planting tomato varieties that are resistant to early blight can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

2. **Crop Rotation**:
   - Avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops to reduce fungal populations in the soil.

3. **Sanitation**:
   - Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce sources of fungal inoculum.
   - Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.

4. **Fungicide Application**:
   - Use fungicides containing chlorothalonil, copper, or mancozeb to manage the disease.
   - Apply fungicides preventively and repeat applications as necessary, following label instructions.

5. **Proper Spacing and Pruning**:
   - Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
   - Prune lower leaves to improve airflow around the base of the plants.

6. **Watering Practices**:
   - Avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and reduce the spread of the fungus.
   - Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infection.
   - Remove and destroy infected leaves or plants promptly to prevent the spread of the fungus.
