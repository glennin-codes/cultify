# Tomato Late Blight

## Definition
**Tomato Late Blight** is a devastating fungal disease affecting tomato plants, caused by the oomycete *Phytophthora infestans*. This disease can rapidly destroy tomato crops, affecting leaves, stems, and fruits.

## Symptoms
1. **Leaf Spots**:
   - Large, irregular, water-soaked lesions that rapidly turn brown.
   - Lesions often have a pale green border and can cover large areas of the leaf.
   - Leaves may curl and die, leading to plant collapse.

2. **Stem Lesions**:
   - Dark, greasy-looking lesions on the stems.
   - Lesions can girdle the stem, leading to plant wilting and death.

3. **Fruit Spots**:
   - Firm, brown lesions on the fruit, often starting at the stem end.
   - Fruits may rot quickly, especially under wet conditions.

## Treatment
1. **Resistant Varieties**:
   - Planting tomato varieties that are resistant to late blight can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

2. **Crop Rotation**:
   - Avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops to reduce oomycete populations in the soil.

3. **Sanitation**:
   - Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce sources of oomycete inoculum.
   - Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the disease.

4. **Fungicide Application**:
   - Use fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper to manage the disease.
   - Apply fungicides preventively and repeat applications as necessary, following label instructions.

5. **Proper Spacing and Pruning**:
   - Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
   - Prune lower leaves to improve airflow around the base of the plants.

6. **Watering Practices**:
   - Avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and reduce the spread of the oomycete.
   - Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infection.
   - Remove and destroy infected leaves or plants promptly to prevent the spread of the disease.
