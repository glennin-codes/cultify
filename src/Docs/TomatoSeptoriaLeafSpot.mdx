# Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot

## Definition
**Tomato Septoria Leaf Spot** is a fungal disease affecting tomato plants, caused by the fungus *Septoria lycopersici*. This disease primarily affects the leaves, leading to significant defoliation and yield loss.

## Symptoms
1. **Leaf Spots**:
   - Small, circular, water-soaked spots with dark borders and tan or gray centers.
   - Spots may have tiny black specks (pycnidia) in the center.
   - Leaves turn yellow and fall off, starting from the bottom of the plant and moving upward.

2. **Stem and Petiole Lesions**:
   - Dark lesions on stems and petioles, though less common.

3. **Fruit Symptoms**:
   - Rarely affects fruits.

## Treatment
1. **Resistant Varieties**:
   - Planting tomato varieties that are resistant to Septoria leaf spot can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

2. **Crop Rotation**:
   - Avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops to reduce fungal populations in the soil.

3. **Sanitation**:
   - Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce sources of fungal inoculum.
   - Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.

4. **Fungicide Application**:
   - Use fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper to manage the disease.
   - Apply fungicides preventively and repeat applications as necessary, following label instructions.

5. **Proper Spacing and Pruning**:
   - Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
   - Prune lower leaves to improve airflow around the base of the plants.

6. **Watering Practices**:
   - Avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and reduce the spread of the fungus.
   - Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infection.
   - Remove and destroy infected leaves or plants promptly to prevent the spread of the fungus.
