# Tomato Target Spot

## Definition
**Tomato Target Spot**, also known as Corynespora leaf spot, is a fungal disease caused by *Corynespora cassiicola*. It primarily affects the leaves, stems, and fruits of tomato plants, leading to yield loss.

## Symptoms
1. **Leaf Spots**:
   - Small, water-soaked spots that enlarge and develop concentric rings, resembling a target.
   - Spots can be dark brown to black.
   - Leaves may yellow and drop prematurely.

2. **Stem and Petiole Lesions**:
   - Dark, elongated lesions on stems and petioles.
   - Lesions can girdle stems, causing wilting and plant death.

3. **Fruit Spots**:
   - Small, sunken, dark spots on the fruit, often with a target-like appearance.
   - Spots can enlarge and cause fruit rot.

## Treatment
1. **Resistant Varieties**:
   - Planting tomato varieties that are resistant to target spot can help reduce the incidence of the disease.

2. **Crop Rotation**:
   - Avoid planting tomatoes in the same soil consecutively. Rotate with non-host crops to reduce fungal populations in the soil.

3. **Sanitation**:
   - Remove and destroy infected plant debris to reduce sources of fungal inoculum.
   - Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of the fungus.

4. **Fungicide Application**:
   - Use fungicides containing chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper to manage the disease.
   - Apply fungicides preventively and repeat applications as necessary, following label instructions.

5. **Proper Spacing and Pruning**:
   - Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity.
   - Prune lower leaves to improve airflow around the base of the plants.

6. **Watering Practices**:
   - Avoid overhead irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and reduce the spread of the fungus.
   - Use drip irrigation to keep foliage dry.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Regularly inspect plants for early signs of infection.
   - Remove and destroy infected leaves or plants promptly to prevent the spread of the fungus.
